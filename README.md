# Next Word Prediction system
It is a deep learning project. In this project I tried to develop a model to predict word(s) that a person likely to type during his/her conversation. It is a very helpful system specially for challenged users as it reduces the number of keystrokes. In this project I employed verious deep learning models which are LSTM, Bi-LSTM, GRU, and after that I tried to develop a hybrid model using these models. This project gives 91% accuracy and the average time taken by the model for predicting words is 0.06 seconds. This system can be personalized for individual users.
